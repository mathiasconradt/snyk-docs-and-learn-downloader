## Issues Detail report

The Issues Detail report displays all known issues in all of your Projects that are being monitored by Snyk. The report gives details about each issue and which of your Projects are affected and provides links to fix information.

The Issues Detail report displays the number of issues as well as the number of unique vulnerabilities that make up the issues.

Quick aggregations are available by categories including **Severity**, **Product Name**, and **Issue Type.**

Individual issues are displayed in a table according to the selected category. You can modify columns as needed.

For a table of only the unique vulnerabilities, use Change Report to switch to the Vulnerabilities Detail report.

## Issues Summary report

The Issues Summary report highlights the value that Snyk is providing by enabling both the identification and resolution of issues.&#x20;

The report provides a glimpse into how well teams are optimizing the use of the Snyk platform for their workflow and provides a means to measure and improve security.

This report enables you to easily understand the current state and trends of the highest security risk items. This report also provides a quick view into where risk is coming from and where remediation efforts are most and least effective.

Use the date filter in the upper right corner of the Issues Summary report to see key metrics and charts for a specified interval.

This report shows a number of key metrics associated with issues in that interval with a comparison to the same metrics in the previous period so you can get a quick understanding of trends. See tooltips in the app for definitions of the metrics.

Scroll down for additional charts that show trend information in greater detail.

Key metrics are then broken down to point out information at the Organization or Project level. You can drill down to see what new and resolved issues were introduced during the date range selected.

## Vulnerabilities Detail report

The Vulnerabilities Detail report is similar to the Issues Detail report but shows issues grouped by Snyk Problem ID ([see Snyk Vulnerability DB](https://security.snyk.io/vuln)).&#x20;

You can easily see how many instances of a vulnerability exist and how many Projects are affected. Use this report to understand which vulnerabilities are most prevalent for both resolution and prevention use cases.

For a table of Total Issues, use Change Reports to switch to the Issues Detail report.

## Featured Zero-Day report

This report addresses primary scenarios for managing and resolving emerging zero-day vulnerabilities, which carry significant consequences and attract substantial attention in the global AppSec community.

Use this report to discover your exposure to issues highlighted in a zero-day publication across various Targets and Projects. The report helps you prioritize zero-day issues and monitor the progress of remediation efforts against any remaining occurrences.

The [Security team at Snyk](https://snyk.io/platform/security-intelligence/) continuously updates the [Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/) with new vulnerabilities several times a day. When the team discovers a major new zero-day vulnerability—typically in a widely used package with high severity that affects many customers—it will be announced and addressed as a zero-day event.

Upon the announcement of a new zero-day event, begin by examining the **Impacted Targets** table to gain a deeper understanding of the exposure. Use filters such as Project Lifecycle, Environment, or Project Criticality to focus solely on Targets associated with Projects in production that are externally exposed or of high criticality. Gaining such insights depends on the [availability of Project attributes](../../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/project-attributes.md#available-attributes-and-their-values).

Next, proceed to the **All** **Issues** table and compile a prioritized list of issues requiring remediation. Typically, prioritization is determined by either the Snyk [Risk Score](../../manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/risk-score.md) or NVD CVSS Score, with emphasis placed on addressing vulnerabilities within sensitive targets. Apply filters based on Project Lifecycle, Environment, or Project Criticality to identify and address these targets promptly.

For continuous monitoring of remediation progress and efficacy, refer to the trend diagrams.\
The **Accumulative Issues Backlog Trend** diagram shows the weekly changes in the zero-day backlog by accumulating the weekly delta between identified and resolved issues. Use this diagram to ensure that your R\&D teams are reducing the zero-day backlog consistently, which will be indicated by a negative trend line.

In parallel, review the **Issues Identified versus Resolved over Time** diagram to conclude whether additional emphasis should be placed on preventing the introduction of new issues or on accelerating the remediation efforts.

## SLA Management report&#x20;

The report presents a set of default SLA targets per severity based on common security standards, such as FedRAMP. These SLA targets can be modified to meet your own security requirements.

The SLA status of an issue can be:

* **Within SLA** - the age of the issue has not exceeded the SLA target, and it is expected to have sufficient lead time before breaching.
* **At Risk** - the issue is considered to be approaching an SLA breach and is flagged as “At Risk”.
* **Breached** - the age of the issue has exceeded the SLA target.

You can control the SLA targets and the transition of issues to the “At Risk” status by editing the **SLA target** and setting the **At risk duration before breach (days)** field.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (639).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>SLA Management Report - Edit SLA targets</p></figcaption></figure>

The SLA report includes additional filters under the SLA category, allowing for better identification of the age of issues in relation to the SLA target:

* **SLA status** - allows the filtering of the report according to a specific SLA status.
* **Issue age** - allows to discover issues within a range of age.
* **Time until breach** - identifies issues that will breach the SLA target within days.

{% hint style="info" %}
The report is, by default, showing only issues that are with high or critical severity. Update the severity filter if you want to view the SLA status for additional severities.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (634).png" alt="" width="300"><figcaption><p>SLA Filters within the filters picker </p></figcaption></figure>

You can share the report with predefined SLA targets by sharing the report URL or return to a predefined SLA report by bookmarking the web page in your browser.

In the **Open issues** section, the **SLA severity breakdown** shows a distribution of severity levels by the SLA compliance status of the viewed Group or Organization.&#x20;

The **SLA trend** shows the cumulative SLA status of issues over time.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (635).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>SLA Management Report - Open issues section</p></figcaption></figure>

The **SLA breakdown table** allows you to compare the SLA compliance results of Organizations in the Group view, or Targets in the Organization view. The table is sorted by default according to the quantity of breached issues.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (636).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>SLA Management Report - SLA Breakdown</p></figcaption></figure>

The **Breached and at-risk open issues** table helps you prioritize issues based on their aging and SLA compliance status. You can use the **Modify Column** picker to add additional columns and learn more about the specific issues.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (637).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>SLA Management Report - Breached and at risk open issues</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
You can download the **SLA Breakdown** and the **Breached and at risk open issues data** in a CSV format using the **Download CSV** option.
{% endhint %}

You can review the SLA results for resolved issues and perform a retrospective analysis by reviewing the **Resolved issues** section.

## Repositories Tested in CI/CD report

{% hint style="info" %}
**Release status**

The Repositories Tested in CI/CD report is in Early Access and available only with Enterprise plans.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To use this report, consider the following prerequisites:

* Snyk CLI version 1.1292.1 or newer.
* Viewing the last commit data requires SCM Group integration. For more details, navigate to [SCM integrations](../../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/).&#x20;
* When testing containers, include the `.git` context as part of the `snyk container test` command.

This report analyzes Snyk tests performed as part of CI/CD pipelines executed using Snyk CLI. It will inform you about the usage of your company and adoption of testing in CI/CD, ensuring repositories are tested as expected and preventing critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations from being deployed and reaching the production environment.

{% hint style="info" %}
* The report results are scoped by a date range filter that you can use to review specific periods. The filter is defaulted to the last 30 days.
* This report provides visibility into Snyk tests (`snyk test`, `snyk code test`, `snyk container test`, `snyk iac test`) executed within your CI pipeline (using CLI). Its primary goal is to help you evaluate test results and determine whether to pass or fail the build process based on these security checks.
* Please note that `snyk monitor` commands are **not** included in this report. While `snyk monitor` is crucial for ongoing security posture and identifying new vulnerabilities, this report specifically tracks tests that actively gate your CI/CD pipeline.
{% endhint %}

The numbers displayed on the main view of the report represent the number of repositories tested in the selected date range per Snyk product.&#x20;

In addition, you can learn about the change in the number of tested repositories compared to the previous sequential period, so you can conclude whether the adoption of CI/CD tests across repositories improved.&#x20;

A green upward arrow indicates that more repositories were tested compared to the previous sequential period, while a red downward arrow indicates the opposite. The absolute change value appears next to the arrow, and the perception of change appears right underneath to measure the degree of change.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (715).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Repositories tested during date range</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
A sequential period refers to a date range covering the last seven days. In this case, the period starts seven days ago and ends today. The previous sequential period spans from 14 days ago to seven days ago. As a result, both sequential periods are of the same duration.
{% endhint %}

#### Repository Test Adoption <a href="#repository-test-adoption" id="repository-test-adoption"></a>

Review the Repository Test Adoption trend to learn more about the adoption over time.\
Represented by the green line, you can see the weekly number of repositories that have been tested compared to the repositories that had commits in the last 30 days, represented by the purple line.&#x20;

This comparison helps determine whether Snyk tests in CI/CD are being increasingly adopted over time and highlights the number of repositories that have received commits but have not been tested in CI/CD.

{% hint style="info" %}
Viewing the last commit data requires SCM Group integration. For more details, navigate to the [SCM integrations](../../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/) page.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You can filter by specific products or by specific organizations or extend the viewed period using the date range filter.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (716).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Repository Test Adoption</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Test Success Rate Trend <a href="#test-success-rate-trend" id="test-success-rate-trend"></a>

The test success rate serves as an indicator of how well the engineering department or specific Snyk Organizations can adopt a "shift left" approach, which aims to identify and resolve issues before the code reaches the build process. This success rate is calculated by dividing the number of tests that passed by the total number of relevant tests conducted.

{% hint style="info" %}
An applicable test is a test that did not fail due to technical issues or a non-supported Project.
{% endhint %}

Having a low success rate can indicate that:

* Snyk tests are failing due to security issues that can be prevented in local development or in the PR Check stages. Snyk recommends testing with the [Snyk IDE](https://docs.snyk.io/scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions) plugin, using [Snyk PR Checks](../../scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/pull-request-checks/) and enroll in a [Snyk Learn](https://docs.snyk.io/getting-started/snyk-learn) program.
* The test success criteria are too strict. To explore this option further, Snyk recommends reviewing the test definitions of the organizations with the lowest success rate, as shown by the Adoption by Organizations widget. For more details about defining test success criteria, navigate to the [Failing of builds in Snyk CLI](../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/failing-of-builds-in-snyk-cli.md) page.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (717).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Test Success Rate Trend</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Adoption by Organizations <a href="#adoption-by-organizations" id="adoption-by-organizations"></a>

Launching an Application Security program to boost testing adoption in CI/CD pipelines can be challenging. This initiative requires collaboration between the AppSec and R\&D teams and will be implemented gradually, with regular progress monitoring.

The Adoption by Organization table facilitates tracking and comparing the adoption rates of Snyk Organizations, helping you identify the organizations that are struggling or lagging behind.

In addition, you can examine the success rate column to surface organizations that have lower success rates.

**Columns descriptions:**

* **Tested Repositories:** the number of repositories that were tested in the selected time range, with an indication of the percentage of change compared to the previous sequential period.
* **Committed Repositories:** the number of repositories that had any commits in the last 30 days at any given time within the selected time range, with an indication of the percentage of change compared to the previous sequential period.
* **Success Rate:**  the portion of successful tests in CI/CD against all other tests that were executed.

#### Repository Test Summary <a href="#repository-test-summary" id="repository-test-summary"></a>

The repository test summary table shows the performed tests during the selected date range.

The default sorting in the table surfaces repositories according to their last commit, allowing you to identify repositories that were expected to be tested in CI/CD pipelines and verify they were tested. Clicking the column names to sort the table according to the selected column. You can sort the table by multiple columns at a time.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Viewing the last commit data requires SCM Group integration. For more details, navigate to the [SCM integrations](../../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/#group-level-snyk-essentials-scm-integrations) page.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You can execute the test on a specific repository branch in the table. The `tested` indicator means that any branch of this repository was tested during the selected date range.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hovering over the TESTED tag reveals the last test performed during the selected date range

## Asset Dashboard

The Asset Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your application and security controls. It displays essential data such as the status and trends of open issues, control coverage, and repository metadata.&#x20;

The Asset Dashboard is a central hub for managing and reviewing assets, making tracking inventory size easier over time and understanding the interaction between different asset types.

While Snyk Inventory enables the discovery and management of your assets that should be secured,  the Snyk Asset Dashboard allows you to go beyond the details and better understand the main building blocks of your inventory. \
\
The Asset Dashboard brings all the asset data that is available in your inventory and helps to answer various questions, such as:

* Does my AppSec program meet the coverage requirements for business-critical assets and strategic applications?
* Are the assets being classified properly according to their criticality?&#x20;
* Do you know which repositories belong to which application or code owners? Are newly introduced repositories being updated with that data?&#x20;
* What are the main programming languages and package managers that are used in repositories that have been worked on recently?&#x20;

### Filters

The filters are located at the top left of the page, with the following filtering options: **Asset Class**, **Asset type,** **Add filter**. The filter selection applies to all available data widgets.

Here are the available filters:

| Filter               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

**\***&#x41;ll filters marked with `*` are visible only if you configured the [application context](../../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/application-context-for-scm-integrations/) catalog for your SCM integrations.

### Repository coverage widget

The repository coverage widget provides an overview of the percentage of scanned repositories compared to the total number of available repositories, using integrated Snyk or third-party security products.

Hover over any column to see how the coverage percentage is calculated.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (585).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Repository Coverage</p></figcaption></figure>

### Asset class breakdown

The asset class breakdown widget surfaces the distribution of repositories and container images by [asset class](../../manage-assets/assets-inventory-components.md#class). Reviewing this widget allows you to determine the percentage of business-critical assets in your inventory and drill down to see the actual assets.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tips**

* Having the context of the asset class is crucial for prioritizing assets. It is recommended to categorize your inventory by implementing [classification policies](../../manage-risk/policies/assets-policies/use-cases-for-policies/classification-policy-use-case.md) to proactively classify existing and newly introduced assets.
* Using the filters enables narrowing down the asset class distribution within specific applications or code owners, as well as focusing on active repositories or a set of assets based on the asset tags.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (584).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Asset Class Breakdown</p></figcaption></figure>

### Top 10 technologies breakdown

The top 10 technologies widget identifies the leading programming languages and frameworks used in repositories. Using the available filters enables you to determine the most commonly used technologies in active or business-critical repositories. Moreover, you can investigate specific applications or code owners.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tips**

* The technology data is available in the [asset tags](../../manage-assets/assets-inventory-components.md#tags).&#x20;
* Click a presented technology to open the inventory page in a new browser tab. This will allow you to review the related repositories in detail.
{% endhint %}

### Top 10 package managers breakdown

The top 10 package managers widget allows you to identify the leading package managers in your inventory. The quantities represent assets of package type. A [package asset](../../manage-assets/assets-inventory-layouts.md#packages) is defined as software or library that is managed by package management systems.&#x20;

### Repository freshness

The repository freshness widget displays the distribution of repositories according to the last commit date:

* **Active**: Had commits in the last 3 months.
* **Inactive**: The last commits were made in the last 3 - 6 months.
* **Dormant**: No commits in the last 6 months.
* **N/A**: Commits data is unavailable.

You can use this widget to surface the quantity of repositories that are more or less maintained in various contexts, such as specific applications.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tips**

You can use the asset class filter to identify business-critical assets that are not being maintained. Click a specific slice to open the inventory page in a new browser tab where you can browse and learn more about those assets.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (583).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Repository freshness</p></figcaption></figure>

### Application context availability

The application context availability widget allows you to discover gaps in the context of assets. The available columns include:

* **Application Context** - displays the analyzed context attribute.
* **Unique Values** - shows how many unique instances exist for an attribute. For example, you can check how many unique applications or code owners are available for any of the listed attributes.
* **Availability in Repos** - indicates the completeness of a certain attribute across the repositories.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tips**

* Before reviewing this widget, ensure that the results are cleaned up by filtering out the "dummy" attribute values, such as "unknown", "-", and so on.\
  You can clean up the values by selecting only the relevant values.
* Filtering by asset class allows you to identify business-critical repositories without a known code owner or associated application.
* Filtering by the "active" value of the repository freshness filter allows you to discover context gaps in repositories that are actively being developed.
* Reviewing the unique values allows you to spot gaps in context. For example, you may realize that the number of unique code owners does not match the number of teams.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (581).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Application Context Availability</p></figcaption></figure>

### Asset source breakdown

The asset source breakdown widget visualizes the quantities of detected assets from various sources. A source can be a platform where the asset is being managed directly (such as an SCM, container registry, and so on) or a platform that enriches the assets (such as security products and ASTs).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tips**

* The widget displays the net quantities of detected assets for each source. If an asset is detected in more than one source, it will be counted once for each detected source.
* When asset inventory quantities seem incomplete or exceed expectations, this widget will help you discover which integrations should be examined and potentially configured differently.
