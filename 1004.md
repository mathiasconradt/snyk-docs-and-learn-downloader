# Issues: List issues for a package

The Snyk REST API endpoint [List issues for a package](../reference/issues.md#orgs-org_id-packages-purl-issues) can be used to get all direct (non-transitive) vulnerabilities for a package using its `purl`, which is a uniform way of identifying software packages across ecosystems as defined in the [package URL specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec).

When you pass a `purl` to the endpoint, Snyk will find any known vulnerabilities for that package and return them as part of the response body.

The API is useful when you have a list of packages and want to retrieve a list of vulnerabilities for a package version.

{% hint style="info" %}
The examples on this page use [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/), but you can use any HTTP client to access the Snyk REST API.
{% endhint %}

## Supported purl types

The current release supports the following `purl` types: `apk`, `cargo`, `cocoapods`, `conan`, `composer`, `deb`, `gem`, `generic`, `golang`, `hex`, `npm`, `nuget`, `pub`, `pypi`, `rpm`, `swift` and `maven`.

If you are interested in support for additional ecosystems, submit a request to [Snyk Support](https://support.snyk.io).

## Request for List issues for a package endpoint

To call the API endpoint, **use the following HTTP request**:

```bash
$ http \
  "https://api.snyk.io/rest/orgs/{org_id}/packages/{purl}/issues" \
  "Authorization: token $API_TOKEN" \
  version==<snyk-api-version>
```

The purl must be **URL-encoded.**

An example using a valid url-encoded purl follows:

```bash
$ http \
  "https://api.snyk.io/rest/orgs/{org_id}/packages/pkg%3Amaven%2fcom.fasterxml.woodstox%2fwoodstox-core%405.0.0/issues" \
  "Authorization: token $API_TOKEN" \
  version==2024-06-26
```

For operating system packages, a vendor must be specified in the namespace portion, and a `distro` qualifier must be specified. Supported vendors include: `debian`, `alpine`, `rhel`, `ubuntu`, `amzn`, `centos`, `oracle`, `rocky`, `sles`.

An example using a valid url-encoded operating system purl follows:

```bash
$ http \
  "https://api.snyk.io/rest/orgs/{org_id}/packages/pkg%3Adeb%2Fdebian%2Fcurl%3Fdistro%3Dbullseye/issues" \
  "Authorization: token $API_TOKEN" \
  version==2024-06-26
```

The Snyk REST API supports pagination. This has a default page limit of **1000**, with a default offset of **0.** Current, next, and previous pages are returned as links in the response. The following parameters can be supplied as query parameters: `offset`, `limit`.

An example paginated request follows:

```bash
$ http \
  "https://api.snyk.io/rest/orgs/{org_id}/packages/pkg%3Amaven%2fcom.fasterxml.woodstox%2fwoodstox-core%405.0.0/issues" \
  "Authorization: token $API_TOKEN" \
  version==2024-06-26 \
  limit==100 \
  offset==0
```

## Response for List issues for a package endpoint

The expected output provides a [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/format/) response that identifies the vulnerabilities associated with the package.

The following example gives the response for a `pypi` package [django](https://security.snyk.io/package/pip/django).

The response provides a list of the vulnerabilities found for the package identified by the purl in the request. The response begins with a description of a vulnerability:

### **Overview of package**

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) through very large inputs with a specific sequence of characters in the `urlize()` and `urlizetrunc()` template filters.

### **Remediation**

Upgrade the package version to 4.2.15,5.0.8 to fix this vulnerability

### Response details
