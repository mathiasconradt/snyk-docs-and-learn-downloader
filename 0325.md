# Snyk CI/CD integrations

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk recommends using the [Snyk CLI ](https://github.com/snyk/cli)for CI/CD integrations for the following reasons:

* You have the flexibility to test in-progress features of the CLI by using the [preview channel](../../snyk-cli/releases-and-channels-for-the-snyk-cli.md#preview).
* The CLI provides feature-rich [stable releases](../../snyk-cli/releases-and-channels-for-the-snyk-cli.md#stable) at a regular cadence.
* With the CLI, you have options to [extend use cases](../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools/) as you deploy Snyk at scale
{% endhint %}

## Adopting a CI/CD integration

When you [decide to use a CI/CD integration,](../git-repository-and-ci-cd-integrations-comparisons.md) you typically adopt the integration in stages. You will select a deployment method and implement strategies for the code you are scanning. See [Snyk CI/CD Integration deployment and strategies](snyk-ci-cd-integration-deployment-and-strategies/).

For detailed information, see the pages for the integration you are using:

* [AWS CodePipeline integration](aws-codepipeline-integration-by-adding-a-snyk-scan-stage/)
* [Azure Pipelines integration](azure-pipelines-integration/)
* [Bitbucket Pipelines integration](bitbucket-pipelines-integration-using-a-snyk-pipe/)
* [CircleCI integration](circleci-integration-using-a-snyk-orb.md)
* [GitHub Actions integration](github-actions-for-snyk-setup-and-checking-for-vulnerabilities/)
* [Jenkins integration](jenkins-plugin-integration-with-snyk.md)
* [Maven integration](maven-plugin-integration-with-snyk.md)
* [TeamCity integration](teamcity-jetbrains-integration-using-the-snyk-security-plugin/)
* [Terraform Cloud integration for IaC](terraform-cloud-integration-for-snyk-iac-using-run-tasks/)
* [Terraform Enterprise integration for IaC](terraform-enterprise-integration-for-snyk-iac.md)

For integration with GitLab pipelines integration, see this [pipeline configuration](https://github.com/snyk-labs/snyk-cicd-integration-examples/blob/master/GitLabCICD/gitlab-npm.yml).

For additional examples of binary and npm integrations for CI/CD, see [GitHub CI/CD examples](https://github.com/snyk-labs/snyk-cicd-integration-examples).

## Support policy <a href="#support-policy" id="support-policy"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
This policy will be effective beginning on June 24, 2025.
{% endhint %}

Snyk supports the latest 12 months of CI/CD plugin versions, ensuring functionality and performance. Older versions are considered End-of-Support (EOS) and will not receive bug fixes or troubleshooting.

Snyk provides fixes only in new versions and cannot fix older versions. Customers must upgrade to benefit from improvements.

This policy fosters innovation while optimizing resources.

If you need help, submit a [request](https://support.snyk.io/) to Snyk Support.
