# Legacy Reports Licenses tab

The **Licenses** area displays all licenses currently used in your Project, a summary of all dependencies in your Projects, and a summary of all of your Projects using the license. This allows you to understand which Projects and dependencies use a license.

License information is available from the **Dependencies** menu option - see [View licenses](../../../manage-risk/reporting/dependencies-and-licenses/view-licenses.md) for more details.
