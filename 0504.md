Containers provide a standard packaging format for applications, but container images can be opaque. This can lead to problems when identifying the software and the vulnerabilities they contain.

## Snyk Container functions

Snyk Container provides tools and integrations to quickly find and fix vulnerabilities. This allows you to create images that have security built-in from the start.

## Snyk Container integrations

Snyk Container provides a range of integrations to import Projects into Snyk. These integrations support different workflows.

For details on available integrations, see [Container registry integrations](container-registry-integrations/) and [Kubernetes integration](kubernetes-integration/).
