# Step 2: Create the Snyk IAM role (API)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recap**\
You have downloaded the Terraform or Amazon Web Services (AWS) CloudFormation template declaring the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for Snyk. Now you need to provision the infrastructure.
{% endhint %}

The process to create the Snyk IAM role is the same whether you are using the Snyk Web UI or Snyk API to onboard your AWS account. Follow the instructions in [Step 2: Create the Snyk IAM role](../aws-integration-web-ui/step-2-create-the-snyk-iam-role.md), then return here to continue with onboarding your account.

## **What's next?**

You can now proceed to [Step 3: Create and scan a Cloud Environment (API)](step-3-create-and-scan-a-cloud-environment-api.md).
