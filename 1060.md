# Your learning

## Finding learning opportunities

You can see all of the lessons and learning paths available at [https://learn.snyk.io/catalog/](https://learn.snyk.io/catalog/). You can search or use the filters to help find learning opportunities that are relevant to your interests and needs. The catalog covers common application security topics and product training for Snyk. For developers, we recommend getting started with the [OWASP Top 10 Learning Path](https://learn.snyk.io/learning-paths/owasp-top-10/).
