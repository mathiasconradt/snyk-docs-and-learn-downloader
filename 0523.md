# Integrate with Google Container Registry (GCR)

Snyk integrates with Google Container Registry (GCR) so you can import your Projects, monitor your containers for vulnerabilities, and fix vulnerabilities as you work. Snyk tests the Projects you have imported for any known security vulnerabilities at a frequency you control.

Refer to the following pages for details:

* [Enable permissions to access GCR](enable-permissions-to-access-gcr.md)
* [Configure integration for GCR](configure-integration-for-gcr.md)
* [Add images to Snyk from GCR](add-images-to-snyk-from-acr.md)

For additional information, see this [introduction to container security best practices](https://snyk.io/learn/container-security/).
