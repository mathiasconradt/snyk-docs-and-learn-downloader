# Prerequisites

## Automated provisioning

Provisioning is the first interaction you have with Snyk before getting access to the Snyk platform and features on your plan. For a detailed walkthrough, see the [Auto-provisioning guide](../../enterprise-setup/auto-provisioning-guide.md).

Provisioning can be completed with a [new](../../enterprise-setup/auto-provisioning-guide.md#sign-up-start-from-scratch) or [existing](../../enterprise-setup/auto-provisioning-guide.md#logging-in-provision-using-an-existing-user-account) user account and must be completed before you continue the rest of the implementation process.

Automated provisioning is enabled only on multi-tenant environments for the following regions:

* ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ **United States**: SNYK-US-01, SNYK-US-02
* ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º **Europe**: SNYK-EU-01
* ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º **Australia**: SNYK-AU-01
