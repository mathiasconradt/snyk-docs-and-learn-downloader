# Determine user roles

## Default  roles

A key consideration when setting up Snyk is determining which [default user roles](../../../snyk-admin/user-roles/pre-defined-roles.md) align with your needs.

The Team plan has the following fixed roles in Snyk, each with a fixed set of permissions. These permissions cannot be changed on the Team plan.

The following are the default roles:

* **Org Admin**: Typically assigned to team leads. Users with this role can add/delete Projects, override Snyk checks, and provision users. It is common to assign this to team leads, admins, and security team users.&#x20;
* **Org Collaborator**: This is the default role in Snyk used for developers. This role is ideal for small teams or for a very developer-first organizational approach.&#x20;

If you need more granularity in roles/permissions, consider upgrading to Snyk Enterprise Plan to access Custom Roles and SSO functionality.
