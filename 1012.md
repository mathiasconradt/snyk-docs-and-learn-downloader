# Create a Snyk App using the Snyk API

When you have an API token and `orgId`, you can use the Snyk API to create your Snyk App by sending a `POST` request to the endpoint [Create a new Snyk App for an organization](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/reference/apps#orgs-org_id-apps-creations):

```
https://api.snyk.io/rest/orgs/{orgId}/apps/creations?version={version}
```

Example CURL request to create a Snyk App:

```bash
curl -L \
  --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.snyk.io/rest/orgs/{org_id}/apps/creations?version=2024-10-15' \
  --header 'Authorization: {YOUR_API_KEY}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \
  --data '{
    "data": {
      "attributes": {
        "context": "tenant",
        "name": "My Awesome Snyk App",
        "redirect_uris": [
          "https://example.com/callback"
        ],
        "scopes": [
          "org.read"
        ]
      },
      "type": "app"
    }
  }'
```

The request body should contain the details for your new App, including the `name`, `context`, `redirect_uris`, and [`scopes`](scopes-to-request.md).

The response includes details necessary to complete the integration: `client_id` and `client_secret`. Use these values with Snyk API endpoints within your App; consider storing them as part of the configuration of your App.

{% hint style="info" %}
Never share the `client_secret` publicly, as it is used to authenticate your App. This is the only time you will see the `client_secret`, so keep it secure and private. If you lose it or if the secret is leaked, you can [rotate your App's clientSecret](manage-app-details.md#rotate-app-clientsecret).
{% endhint %}
