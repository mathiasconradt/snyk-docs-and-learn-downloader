# Scan Serverless files

Snyk IaC supports the scanning of Serverless configuration files only through the CLI.

Users can share their Serverless scan results with the platform and present them in the UI by using the [Share CLI results feature](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac/share-cli-results-with-the-snyk-web-ui.md).

For more information, see [Test your Serverless files with Snyk CLI](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac/test-your-iac-files/serverless-files.md).
