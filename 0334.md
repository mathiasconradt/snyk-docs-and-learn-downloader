## CI/CD troubleshooting

This section provides a few tips to help troubleshoot or scale CI/CD integrations.

### Step 1: Try to replicate with Snyk CLI

If the CLI and the pipeline are running the same engine, try to clone the Project and scan with CLI.

Try various CLI options. Use the Snyk CL to find and fix known vulnerabilities as you run it in the pipeline. For more information, see the [CLI documentation](../../../snyk-cli/).

### Step 2: Get logs

If you are able to replicate with the CLI and the problem still exists, ask the CLI to output the debug logging using the following command: `DEBUG=*` or use the `-d` option to capture logs:

```
snyk test -d
```

or

```
DEBUG=* snyk test
```

### Step 3: Use the CLI instead of the plugin

Try to replace the native plugin with the CLI by installing the CLI. See [Install the Snyk CLI ](../../../snyk-cli/install-or-update-the-snyk-cli/)for instructions.
