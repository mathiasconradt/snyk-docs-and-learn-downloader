3. Fetch `one`/`all` repos under the fetched/provided projects.
4. Remove the repos that are not monitored by Snyk (if the `skipSnykMonitoredRepos` flag was **not set** and the `SNYK_TOKEN` was exported) and create a Repo list.
5. Create an import file for unmonitored repos to use for easily importing repos into Snyk account (if the `importConfDir` flag was set).
6. Fetch the commits for the fetched/provided repo/s and create a Contributors list.
7. Count the commits for the repo/s by the contributors.
8. Remove the contributors that were specified in the exclusion file (if `the exclusionFilePath` flag was set and a valid path to a text file was provided).
