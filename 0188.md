# Validate your Snyk plan

Confirm your Snyk license has been applied correctly. Navigate to your Organization by clicking the Organization name on the left menu and click **Settings**. Confirm the license has been applied to this Organization by reviewing Usage, Plans, and Billing. Tests should be unlimited for the products purchased, and a Team plan should be indicated.

The proper license setup ensures you can fully use Snyk capabilities without limitations. It also guarantees you remain compliant with Snyk terms of use. If the license was incorrectly assigned,  contact Snyk support.
