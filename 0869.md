# Snyk CLI for Snyk Code

The [Snyk Command Line Interface](../../) (CLI) enables you to bring the functionality of Snyk Code into your development workflow. Using the Snyk CLI, you can run Snyk Code tests locally or incorporate them into your CI/CD pipeline to scan your source code for security vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites for using the Snyk CLI with Snyk Code

Before using the Snyk CLI for testing your source code with Snyk Code, verify you have the following prerequisites:

* A Snyk account.
* Repositories with code in [supported languages and frameworks](../../../supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks/).
* The **Snyk Code** option [enabled in your Snyk Org settings](../../../scan-with-snyk/snyk-code/configure-snyk-code.md).
* The Snyk CLI installed and authenticated.
  * For instructions, see [Install or update the Snyk CLI](../../install-or-update-the-snyk-cli/) and [Authenticate the Snyk CLI](../../authenticate-to-use-the-cli.md).
  * The minimum Snyk CLI version for Snyk Code, version 1.716.0. Snyk recommends using the latest version of the CLI.

## Using the Snyk CLI for Snyk Code tests

To test your repository code using the Snyk CLI, use the [`snyk code test`](../../commands/code-test.md) command.\
For more information, see [Scan source code with Snyk Code using the CLI](scan-source-code-with-snyk-code-using-the-cli.md).

Before running Snyk Code tests with the CLI, you may want to do the following:

* [Update your Snyk CLI version](../../install-or-update-the-snyk-cli/).
* [Set the Organization for the CLI tests](set-the-snyk-organization-for-the-cli-tests.md).
* [Exclude directories and files from the Snyk Code test](exclude-directories-and-files-from-snyk-code-cli-tests.md).

For information about using the snyk code test command and the results, see the pages in this section of the documentation and [snyk-to-html](../cli-tools/snyk-to-html.md).
