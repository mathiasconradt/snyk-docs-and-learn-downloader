# Bitbucket Server/Data Center - prerequisites and steps to install and configure Broker

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**

Snyk Code PR Checks are available only for Bitbucket DC/Server versions 7.0 and above.
{% endhint %}

Before installing, **review the general instructions** for the installation method you plan to use, [Helm](../install-and-configure-broker-using-helm.md) or [Docker](../install-and-configure-broker-using-docker.md).

The **prerequisites** follow.

Before installing the Bitbucket Server/Data Center Broker, ask your Snyk account team to provide you with a Broker token.&#x20;

You must have Docker or a way to run Docker Linux containers. Some Docker deployments for Windows run only Windows containers. Ensure that your deployment is capable of running Linux containers.

**Continue** with the steps to install using [Docker](bitbucket-server-data-center-install-and-configure-using-docker.md) or [Helm](bitbucket-server-data-center-install-and-configure-using-helm.md).
