# Integrate with Docker Hub

Snyk integrates with Docker Hub to enable you to import snapshots of your Projects to the Snyk Web UI and then test and monitor image layers directly from your registries. Refer to these pages for details:

* [Configure integration for Docker Hub](configure-the-integration-with-docker-hub.md)
* [Docker Hub - add Projects and images to the Snyk UI](docker-hub-add-projects-and-images-to-the-snyk-ui.md)
