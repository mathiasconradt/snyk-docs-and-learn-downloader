# Scan with Snyk

You can use Snyk to scan and secure your codebase and cloud infrastructure configurations, taking advantage of the Snyk capabilities in Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA), and  Infrastructure as Code analysis.

For more information, see [Scanning overview](scanning-overview.md) and [Start scanning](start-scanning.md).

## Select scanning methods

Snyk supports scanning methods that correspond to Snyk products. Choose the right scanning method for the job you want to do, to find and fix issues not only early in the Software Development Life Cycle, but also after your web application is live.

* [Snyk Open Source](snyk-open-source/): scan your open-source libraries for vulnerabilities and license issues.\
  For more information, see [Open Source Security Explained](https://snyk.io/series/open-source-security/).
* [Snyk Code](snyk-code/): scan your code for security vulnerabilities using source code analysis.\
  For more information, see [Exploring the advanced technologies behind Snyk Code](https://snyk.io/blog/advanced-technologies-behind-snyk-code/).
* [Snyk Container](snyk-container/): scan for container image and workload vulnerabilities.
* [Snyk Infrastructure as Code: ](snyk-iac/)scan for issues in your cloud infrastructure configurations, before and after deployment.
* [Snyk API & Web](https://snyk.io/product/dast-api-web/): discover and test the security of all your APIs and web apps, including those AI-generated. See [Snyk API & Web Help Center](https://help.probely.com/en/) and [Snyk API & Web Developers documentation](https://developers.probely.com/).

## Run pull request checks

Scan and automatically address potential vulnerabilities when you review pull requests (PRs), to prevent security issues in production, for your open-source libraries and your own code.

Snyk can also retest and alert on the default branch on a scheduled basis and show results.&#x20;

For more information, see [Run PR checks](pull-requests/pull-request-checks/).
