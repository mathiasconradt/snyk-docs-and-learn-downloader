# Protect your code with patches

The `@snyk/protect` [package](https://github.com/snyk/snyk/tree/master/packages/snyk-protect) (replaced the `snyk protect` command) applies the patches specified in your `.snyk file` to the local file system. See the [README](https://github.com/snyk/snyk/tree/master/packages/snyk-protect) for information on how to use the package and how to migrate from `snyk protect`.
