# V1 API

## About the V1 API

{% hint style="info" %}
The Snyk API is available only for Enterprise plans.

For more information, see [Plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans).

The V1 API will be deprecated eventually, as further Snyk developments are now focused on the REST API.
{% endhint %}

The V1 API enables you to test a package for issues as they are defined by Snyk, and to automate Snyk processes to accomplish your specific workflows. Customers and partners can perform functions including:

* Accessing vulnerability data
* Scanning Projects and applications
* Receiving remediation advice
* Viewing user data to build custom security solutions

The V1 API endpoints are available in the [Reference](reference/).&#x20;

## API URLs

Snyk is hosted in the following regions. Each region has its own base URL.

<table><thead><tr><th width="189">Region</th><th>Base URL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SNYK-US-01</td><td><code>https://api.snyk.io/v1/</code></td></tr><tr><td>SNYK-US-02</td><td><code>https://api.us.snyk.io/v1/</code></td></tr><tr><td>SNYK-EU-01 </td><td><code>https://api.eu.snyk.io/v1/</code> </td></tr><tr><td>SNYK-AU-01</td><td><code>https://api.au.snyk.io/v1/</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
This API is available only over HTTPS. Calling the API over HTTP will yield a 404 for all requests.
{% endhint %}

## Authorization

To use this API, you must get your token from Snyk. You can find the token in your [personal account settings](https://snyk.io/account/) after you register with Snyk and log in. For details, see [Authentication for API](authentication-for-api/).&#x20;

Provide the token in an `Authorization` header with the token, preceded by `token`:

```
Authorization: token API_KEY
```

Otherwise, a 401 "Unauthorized" response will be returned.

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

{
    "code": 401,
    "error": "Not authorised",
    "message": "Not authorised"
}
```

## Rate limiting

Snyk limits the requests to the V1 API to help provide a stable experience for customers.

The V1 API has a default rate limit of **2,000 requests per minute**, but some specific endpoints have lower limits. Refer to the reference docs for each endpoint to see the rate limits.

If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429` error response.

## Errors

The V1 API uses standard HTTP error codes for error responses.

```json
{
    "code": 404,
    "message": "Org 39db46b1-ad57-47e6-a87d-e34f6968030b was not found or you may not have the correct permissions to access the org.",
    "error": "Org 39db46b1-ad57-47e6-a87d-e34f6968030b was not found or you may not have the correct permissions to access the org."
}
```

The error reference is also supplied in the `x-error-reference` header in the server reply.

Example `500` response:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
x-error-reference: a45ec9c1-065b-4f7b-baf8-dbd1552ffc9f
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 1848
Vary: Accept-Encoding
