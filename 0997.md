# Scenarios for using the Snyk API

The Snyk API scenarios identify procedures you can use to accomplish tasks with Snyk applications using the API. The scenarios listed on this page are grouped in Snyk processes and provided in a [repository](https://github.com/snyk-playground/cx-tools/tree/main/scripts) or on the user docs site. Links are included.

If you have issues when using these procedures, contact your Technical Success Manager or Solutions Engineer, or [submit a ticket](https://support.snyk.io) to Snyk support.
