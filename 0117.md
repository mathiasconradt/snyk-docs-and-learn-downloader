# GitHub Enterprise - install and configure using Docker

Before installing, review the [prerequisites ](./)and the general instructions for installation using [Docker](../install-and-configure-broker-using-docker.md).

This integration is useful to ensure a secure connection with your on-premise or cloud GitHub Enterprise deployment.

## Configure Broker to be used for GitHub Enterprise

To use the Snyk Broker client with a GitHub Enterprise deployment, **run** `docker pull snyk/broker:github-enterprise`. Refer to [GitHub Enterprise - environment variables for Snyk Broker](github-enterprise-environment-variables-for-snyk-broker.md) for definitions of the environment variables.

**If necessary,** go to the [Advanced configuration page](../advanced-configuration-for-snyk-broker-docker-installation/) and **make any configuration changes** needed, such as providing the CA (Certificate Authority) to the Broker Client configuration if the GitHub Enterprise instance is using a private certificate, and setting up [proxy support](../advanced-configuration-for-snyk-broker-docker-installation/proxy-support-with-docker.md).

## Docker run command to set up a Broker Client for GitHub Enterprise

**Copy the following command** to set up a fully configured Broker Client to analyze Open Source, IaC, Container, Code files (with the Code Agent), and Snyk Essentials information. Enable [Snyk Essentials](../../../../../scan-with-snyk/snyk-apprisk.md) to identify your application assets, monitor them, and prioritize the risks.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Multi-tenant settings for regions**\
When installing, you must add a command in your script to set the `BROKER_SERVER_URL`. This is the URL of the Broker server for the region where your data is hosted. For the commands and URLs to use, see [Broker URLs](../../../../../working-with-snyk/regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#broker-server-urls).
{% endhint %}

```bash
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=<secret-broker-token> \
           -e BROKER_SERVER_URL=<broker-region-url> \
           -e GITHUB_TOKEN=<secret-github-token> \
           -e GITHUB=<your.ghe.domain.com (no http/s)> \
           -e GITHUB_API=<your.ghe.domain.com/api/v3 (no http/s)> \
           -e GITHUB_GRAPHQL=<your.ghe.domain.com/api (no http/s)> \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=<http://broker.url.example:8000 (dns/IP:port)> \
           -e ACCEPT_IAC=tf,yaml,yml,json,tpl \
           -e ACCEPT_CODE=true \
           -e ACCEPT_ESSENTIALS=true \
       snyk/broker:github-enterprise
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk Essentials is set by default to **`false`**. Enable it by setting the flag to **`true`**.
{% endhint %}

## Start the Broker Client container and verify the connection with GitHub Enterprise

Paste the Broker Client configuration to start the Broker Client container.

After the container is up, the GitHub Enterprise Integrations page shows the connection to GitHub Enterprise, and you can `Add Projects.`

## Basic troubleshooting for Broker with GitHub Enterprise

### **Support of big manifest files (> 1Mb) for GitHub Enterprise**

One reason that open Fix/Upgrade PRs or PR/recurring tests fail may be fetching big manifest files (> 1Mb). To address this issue, enable an additional variable in your broker by following the Additional instructions for [Snyk Open Source Scans (SCA) of large manifest files (Docker setup) ](https://docs.snyk.io/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/install-and-configure-snyk-broker/advanced-configuration-for-snyk-broker-docker-installation/snyk-open-source-scans-sca-of-large-manifest-files-docker-setup)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To ensure the maximum possible security, Snyk does not enable this rule by default, because use of this endpoint means that the Snyk platform can theoretically access all files in this repository, because the path does not include specific allowed file names.
{% endhint %}

### **Additional troubleshooting for Broker with GitHub Enterprise**

* Run `docker logs <container id>` to look for any errors, where the container id is the GitHub Enterprise Broker container ID.
* Ensure relevant ports are exposed to GitHub Enterprise.
