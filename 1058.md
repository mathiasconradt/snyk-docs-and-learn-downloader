# Candidates for upcoming API end-of-life cadences

This page contains the list of V1, non-GA REST, and older versions of GA REST endpoints that are potential candidates for future end-of-life cadences. To see which endpoints are end-of-life'd, see [API EOL endpoints and key dates](api-eol-endpoints-and-key-dates.md).

If an endpoint is listed in the table below, it does not guarantee that the endpoint will be included in the next end-of-life cadence. In addition, an endpoint can go straight into the next end-of-life cadence without having to be listed in the table below.&#x20;

The endpoints in this list, and in any end-of-life cadence, must adhere to our end-of-life criteria, which require that the endpoints have:&#x20;

* A GA REST equivalent or equivalents (except in the rare case where a V1 API does not have or need a GA REST equivalent)
* Functionality parity between V1 and GA REST (unless explicitly stated otherwise in the migration guide)
* A migration guide by our field specialists for ease of migration

Endpoints that are end-of-life'd do not appear in the list that follows, as the list is for future candidates for end-of-life, and can be found on the [API EOL endpoints and key dates](api-eol-endpoints-and-key-dates.md) page.&#x20;
