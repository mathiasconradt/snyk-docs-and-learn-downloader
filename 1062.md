Snyk Learn offers reports to help you track learning progress across your Organization.

## Overview report

The Overview report provides a high-level view of progress across your Organization. This report shows how many users in your Organization have started and completed each lesson or learning path.

## Detailed report

The Detailed report provides individual user-level progress tracking within your Organization. This report includes the following progress data for specific lessons or learning paths:

* completion status
* when the lesson or learning path was completed
* when the lesson was previously completed, if lesson progress was reset after the user completed it&#x20;

## Exporting reports&#x20;

All reports are available as interactive table views and downloadable CSV reports.

User progress is associated with individual users, meaning that if they are members of multiple Organizations, their lesson progress will be the same across all Organizations.

The report CSV contains the historical completions and current progress. The learning path overview report CSV contains the current learning path progress and the last completion date.

Progress reporting is also available through the Snyk Learn API (beta), offering two endpoints:

* [Org catalog progress](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-10-15#get-/orgs/-org_id-/learn/progress/catalog) - progress mapped to the Snyk Learn catalog
* [Org user progress](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-10-15#get-/orgs/-org_id-/learn/progress/users) - progress mapped to the Snyk user&#x20;
