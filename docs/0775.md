# Manage users in Organizations

In the **Organization** where you want to manage users, select the **Members** menu option.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must have the permissions required to perform these tasks. For details, see [Pre-defined user roles](../../user-roles/pre-defined-roles.md) for a list of permissions.
{% endhint %}

You can do the following on the **Add members** screen:

* Select **Invite new members** to send an email invitation to a new user. Enter the email addresses of users to invite, separated by commas, and click **Send invite**.
* Select **Add existing members** to add existing members of your Group to the Organization. Select the users when prompted and click **Invite members.**
* For Free plan users only:\
  Select **Invite by link** to send a link; click **Copy link** and send the link yourself. Note that an invite link expires after 48 hours.
* Use the **New members join as** dropdown to define the default role of a user when joining, such as **Org admin**. For details, see [Manage permissions](../../user-roles/pre-defined-roles.md).

2. In the **Pending invites in \_your organization's name**\_ modal that appears, click the trash icon next to the name of the user to cancel the invite.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For Enterprise plan customers who create custom roles, Snyk prevents users from assigning roles to other users who have more privileges. If you try to update a role, invite a new user, or add an existing user with a role that has more privileges than you have, you will see the error **Cannot assign higher privilege role**.
{% endhint %}

2. Click **Delete member from** _**your organizationâ€™s name**_ when prompted.
