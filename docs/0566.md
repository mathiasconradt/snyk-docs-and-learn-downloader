# Snyk IaC

With Snyk Infrastructure as Code (IaC), you can secure cloud infrastructure configurations before and after deployment.&#x20;

With Snyk IaC, you can:

* Write secure configurations for [HashiCorp Terraform](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-terraform-files/), [AWS CloudFormation](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-cloudformation-files/), [Kubernetes](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-kubernetes-configuration-files/), and [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-arm-configuration-files.md) - for IDE, SCM, CLI, and Terraform Cloud/Enterprise workflows.
* View issues and receive [fix advice](getting-started-with-current-iac.md) so you can make changes directly to code, before applications reach production.
* [Detect drift](detect-drift-and-manually-created-resources/) and manually created resources in your cloud.
* Onboard, scan, and test deployed cloud environments for misconfigurations for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud environments.

For a list of supported IaC languages and cloud providers, see [Supported IaC and cloud providers](supported-iac-languages-cloud-providers-and-cloud-resources/).
