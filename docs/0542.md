```

```

* Your Kubernetes cluster must have a Kubernetes `linux/amd64` worker node.
* Your Kubernetes cluster must be able to communicate with Snyk outbound over HTTPS.
* [Enable the Kubernetes Integration ](../overview-of-kubernetes-integration/enable-the-kubernetes-integration.md)to get your **Integration ID.**
* Create a **Group** or **Organization** **service account token**. For more information, see [Service accounts](../../../../enterprise-setup/service-accounts/). Different roles allow the integration to publish data:

{% hint style="info" %}
The Snyk Controller Kubernetes integration is designed to be deployed into your cluster. It has not been tested on Serverless FaaS deployment options such as Fargate, Google Cloud Run, and Azure Container Instances. Deployment into serverless platforms may be unreliable and is not recommended or supported.
