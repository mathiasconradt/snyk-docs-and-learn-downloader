# Security policies

Group administrators can define Open Source and Container security policies, providing an automated way to identify certain issues or types of issues and apply actions like changing the severity of or ignoring an issue based on specified conditions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Security policies are applicable to Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container Projects.
{% endhint %}

You can [create a security policy and set rules](create-a-security-policy-and-rules.md) by clicking the **Policies** menu option on the Group Overview page to open the Policy manager:

You can [apply a policy to Project attributes](../assign-policies-to-projects.md) or [apply a policy to an Organization](../assign-a-policy-to-an-organization.md).
