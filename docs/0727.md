# Use cases for policies

Gain a better understanding of the policies you can use by going through the following use cases. These are only examples of some situations where policies can be applied. You can customize your policies as needed. The **Send Email** and **Send Slack Message** actions are both notifications and are treated as a single use case.&#x20;

* [Coverage control](coverage-control-policy-use-case.md)
* [Coverage and Coverage gap](coverage-and-coverage-gap-policies.md)
* [Classification](classification-policy-use-case.md)
* [Tagging](tagging-policy-use-case.md)
* [Notifications](notification-policy-use-case.md)

Each type of policy is accompanied by a use case, explaining a practical way of using the policy. The use cases provide a clear example of one of the possible ways of using the policy and offer details about the conditions needed for the filters and actions when building your policy.
