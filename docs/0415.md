# Slack integration

{% hint style="warning" %}
Snyk recommends that all customers use the [Slack App](slack-app.md), as the Slack integration is outdated.
{% endhint %}

You can set up Slack to receive Snykâ€™s alerts about new vulnerabilities that affect your Projects and new upgrades or patches that have become available.

{% hint style="info" %}
Vulnerabilities detected on initial import of projects are not sent to Slack immediately.
{% endhint %}

## Slack notification types

You can get the following alerts in Slack:

A newly disclosed vulnerability:

A new upgrade or patch is available for a vulnerability that you previously ignored or patched.

## Set up the Slack integration

To set up the integration, you must generate a Slack webhook. You can do this either via the [Incoming WebHooks app](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks) or by [creating your own Slack app](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).

Once you have generated your Slack Webhook URL, go to your **Manage Organization** settings and enter the URL.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only webhooks created with Slack Apps are supported; webhooks created with Slack Workflows are not supported.
{% endhint %}
