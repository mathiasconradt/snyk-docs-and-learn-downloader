# Configure notifications

{% hint style="info" %}
See [Manage notifications](../../../../snyk-admin/manage-notifications.md) for more details.
{% endhint %}

Snyk sends different types of alerts to teams based on Group and Organization settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk strongly recommends disabling notifications for the Group and the first Organization by default, before you create additional Organizations and start scanning applications.
{% endhint %}

## Setting default Organization notifications

If you want alerts to be sent by default for Projects imported into the Organization, you can have Snyk send notifications for either vulnerabilities or license issues or for both. You can also limit the notifications to only High and Critical severity issues.&#x20;

The following video demonstrates how to set notification defaults for Organizations:

## Setting default individual notifications

Encourage individuals to set up their own notification preferences, if they want to customize how they receive alerts for specific Projects.

The following video demonstrates how to set notification defaults for individual users:
