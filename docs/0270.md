# Application context for SCM Integrations

## What is Application Context?

The application context for SCM integrations provides a comprehensive and interconnected overview of application assets. This context is crucial for assessing security risks and their potential implications, as it outlines the entire structure and components of the applications involved.

Use Application Context to integrate with Internal Developer Portals (IDPs) and service catalogs such as ServiceNow CMDB, Atlassian Compass, and others. These platforms allow Snyk to automate the collection of essential context, including asset type, ownership, and lifecycle.

The application context provides broader access to resources and services in an application. You can use it to:

* Prepare a comprehensive inventory of your application environment, ensuring it includes crucial metadata. This should encompass elements such as SCM topics and the associated developers.
* Gather relevant information to effectively assess and manage application security vulnerabilities and identify potential risks.
* Create a streamlined data flow by working cohesively with assets identified through Snyk Essentials SCM integrations

By leveraging Application context, you can achieve a deeper understanding of your application's security posture. After the integration is set, use the application context that can be leveraged across Snyk to classify repositories, set Asset policier, or filter reports.&#x20;

These are the available integrations that you can set up for the application context:

* [Backstage file](./#backstage-file-for-scm-integrations)&#x20;
* [ServiceNow CMDB](./#servicenow-cmdb-for-scm-integrations)
* [Atlassian Compass](./#atlassian-compass)
* [Harness](./#harness)
* [OpsLevel](./#opslevel)
* [Datadog Service Catalog](./#datadog-service-catalog) &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The Application Context integrations on this page work in conjunction with assets found through Snyk Essentials SCM integrations. If there is no Snyk Essentials SCM integration configured at the Group level on the Integrations page, then data will not populate from these integrations.
{% endhint %}

## Backstage file for SCM integrations

{% hint style="info" %}
**Release status**

The Backstage file integration is in Early Access and available with Snyk Enterprise plans.
{% endhint %}

Backstage is a service catalog that allows users to add metadata or annotations to their repositories, helping to organize and categorize the available resources for easier navigation and understanding. You can leverage your SCM integration to pull metadata associated with Backstage catalog files into Snyk Essentials.

You can use the Backstage catalog file for GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, BitBucket Cloud, and BitBucket on-prem SCM integrations.

### Required Parameters for Backstage file

* A configured SCM integration.&#x20;
* The `catalog-info.yaml` file from your Project.

### Integration Hub setup for Backstage file

1. Open the **Integration Hub** menu.&#x20;
2. Select an SCM integration.&#x20;
3. Click the **Settings** option of the SCM integration.&#x20;
4. Enable the **Add Backstage Catalog** option.
5. Optional - if the Backstage catalog filename in your repository is not `catalog-info.yaml` you can change the default value in the Backstage catalog filename field.
6. Select at least one attribute you want to add to Snyk Essentials.

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk Essentials parses the fields of the detected file using the default field names unless an alternate field name is specified.
{% endhint %}

7. Click the **Done** button.

After you finish configuring the Backstage catalog, Snyk Essentials starts enriching your repository assets with the data found in the backstage catalog .yaml file.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you set up the catalog attributes, you must use the specific service-level attributes, for example `attribute.name.`
{% endhint %}
