# Test public npm packages before use

You can use `snyk test` to **scrutinize a public package before installing it**, to see if it has known vulnerabilities or not. Use the package name to test the latest version of the package.

`snyk test ionic@1.6.5`

You can also provide a specific version or range using `snyk test module[@semver-range]`.
