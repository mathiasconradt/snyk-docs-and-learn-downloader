# OAuth 2.0 authentication does not work

## A new browser tab does not open automatically  <a href="#windows" id="windows"></a>

* Copy the provided URL to the clipboard by clicking the corresponding button.
* Open a new browser tab manually.
* Paste from your clipboard and follow the authentication procedure.

## I have no access to the Snyk website and am unable to authenticate <a href="#windows" id="windows"></a>

The OAuth 2.0 protocol is highly dynamic, and there is no way to copy and paste a short-lived token.&#x20;

For such cases, each of the IDEs provides a setting to fall back to the Snyk API token.&#x20;
