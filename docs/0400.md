# Language support for TeamCity integration

Snyk supports all TeamCity projects regardless of which Git repo is used.

All languages supported by both [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/features/languages/) and [Snyk](../../../supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks/) can be scanned for vulnerabilities by this plugin.
