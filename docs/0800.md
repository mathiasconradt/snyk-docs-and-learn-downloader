# Remove members from Groups and Orgs using the API

To remove members from Groups and Organizations programmatically from user accounts, you can use the API as explained in the steps that follow. You cannot use these API calls to remove service accounts.

## Remove Organization memberships

### Step 1: Get a list of Organization members

**Request**: `GET https://api.snyk.io/v1/org/{orgId}/members`

**Endpoint**: [List members](../../snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1.md#org-orgid-members)

This call returns an array of all non-admin members of the Organization. Save the `id` of each user who needs to be removed from the Organization.

### Step 2: Remove a member from an Organization

**Request**: `DELETE https://api.snyk.io/v1/org/{orgId}/members/update/{userId}`

**Endpoint**: [Remove a member from the organization](../../snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1.md#org-orgid-members-userid-1)

For each user, call the endpoint to remove that member from the Organization using the user id you saved previously.

For a successful request, the response is `200 OK`.

Look at the Organization members page to verify that the member has been removed.

{% hint style="info" %}
When a member is removed from an Organization, if the Organization is a part of a Group, the user continues to exist in the Group as a Group Member. To completely remove the user from the Group, follow the steps in the next section.
{% endhint %}

## Remove Group memberships

### Step 1: Get a list of Group members

**Request**: `GET https://api.snyk.io/v1/group/groupId/members`

**Endpoint**: [List all members in a group](../../snyk-api/reference/groups-v1.md#group-groupid-members)

This call returns an array of all members of the Group. Save the `id` of each user who needs to be removed from the Group.

### Step 2: Remove a member from a Group

**Request**: PATCH https://api.snyk.io/rest/groups/{group\_id}/users/{id}?version=2024-07-10\~beta

**Endpoint**: [Update a user's role in a group](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-09-04%7Ebeta&_gl=1*191l4f9*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MjE0MDU5NzcuQ2p3S0NBanduZWkwQmhCLUVpd0FBMnh1QmlwWlhrR2JvVy16SGJLb0hGZDk4SU80TlprcGMtcjM4bk8yOXpFMXZFRUJVbHY1LWdnVm1Cb0NHY2dRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_ga*MTM5MDkzOTgyMC4xNzA0NzI3Nzk5*_ga_X9SH3KP7B4*MTcyMjI3NzI0OS40ODAuMS4xNzIyMjc5MjIxLjQ2LjAuMA..#patch-/groups/-group_id-/users/-id-) (Beta, use current version)

**Body:**

```postman_json
{
    "data": {
        "attributes": {
            "membership": null
        },
        "id": "<user-id>",
        "type": "user"
    }
}
```

For each user, to remove that member from the Group, call the endpoint using the user id you saved previously.

For a successful request, the response is `200 OK`.

Look at the Group members page to verify the user has been removed.

{% hint style="info" %}
When a member is removed from a Group, the user continues to exist in Snyk. To completely delete all data associated with the user, follow the step in the next section.
{% endhint %}

## Delete Group members

When an SSO connection is associated with only one Group, the following call can completely delete a Group member from the system. This delete action also complies with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) requirements.

**Request**: DELETE `https://api.snyk.io/rest/groups/{group_id}/sso_connections/{sso_id}/users/{user_id}?version=2023-01-30~beta`

**Endpoint**: [Delete a user from a group SSO connection](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-09-04%7Ebeta#delete-/groups/-group_id-/sso_connections/-sso_id-/users/-user_id-) (Beta, use current version)

You can find the `{sso_id}` on the Snyk Web UI; navigate to **Group** >**Settings** >**SSO** >**Step 3**. If you need help, reach out to your Account team.
