# Disable the Kubernetes integration

To disable the Kubernetes integration:

1. Uninstall the Snyk Controller from your cluster.

You can use Helm to do so. With Helm, you must determine the release name. For example:

`$ helm ls --short`

`snyk-monitor`

You can then delete the release: `$ helm delete snyk-monitor`

2. On the Organization integration settings page, click **Disconnect** . This invalidates the credentials used to import and synchronize new workloads.

&#x20;If you are not using Helm, remove the `snyk-monitor` namespace.&#x20;
