You can edit the **Project Notification Settings** and update the **Test & Automated Pull Request Frequency**. You can also retrieve the **Project ID** for use in Snyk API calls.

The default test frequency and available test frequencies vary depending on the type of Project: Open Source, Code analysis, Container, or IaC. For more information, see [Test frequency settings](./#test-frequency-settings) on the Snyk Projects page. You can also set test frequency by using the API endpoint [Updates project by project ID](../../snyk-api/reference/projects.md#orgs-org_id-projects-project_id).
{% endhint %}
