# Prerequisites for Universal Broker

{% hint style="info" %}
Using Snyk Broker on Windows is not supported. Snyk recommends that Windows users deploy Broker using Linux.

Using the snyk-broker-config CLI tool is supported on Windows.
{% endhint %}

Before installing the Universal Broker `snyk-broker-config` CLI tool, be sure you have met the following prerequisites. If you need help, contact your Snyk account team.

* Client machine system requirements: one CPU and 256 MB of RAM.
* Network access that is allowed by any firewalls installed on your network: an outbound TLS (443) to <kbd>https://broker.snyk.io</kbd> AND `https://api.snyk.io` or your [regional Broker URL](../../../working-with-snyk/regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#broker-urls).
* A Snyk account and your personal Snyk API token; you cannot use a service account.
* Snyk Tenant admin permissions. If you are not a Tenant admin, you can reach out to your team's Tenant admin [to add you](../../../snyk-admin/tenant-groups-and-organizations/tenant/manage-users-in-a-tenant.md). Otherwise, reach out to your support team member or [raise a support case](https://support.snyk.io/s/).
* A new Snyk Broker Admin Organization created in the Group of your choice in your Tenant, not a personal Organization. See [Create an Organization](../../../snyk-admin/groups-and-organizations/organizations/create-and-delete-organizations.md#create-an-organization) for details.
* An SCM token or password. Snyk Broker does not support authentication with the mTLS method.
* Node 20 or higher installed.
* Docker configured to pull images from Docker Hub in order to install with Docker.

Snyk recommends that you add SNYK\_TOKEN and TENANT\_ID in your terminal session environment variables now, using the following commands:

* `export SNYK_TOKEN=xxxx (Linux/Mac)`
* `export TENANT_ID=yyyy (Linux/Mac)`
* `set SNYK_TOKEN=xxxx (Windows)`
* `set TENANT_ID=yyyy (Windows)`

See [Obtain and use your Snyk API token](../../../getting-started/#obtain-and-use-your-snyk-api-token) for instructions on finding your SNYK\_TOKEN.  To find your TENANT\_ID:

1. Log into the Snyk UI.
2. Click your **Tenant name**. **I**f you are a member of multiple Tenants, navigate to the Tenant where the Universal Broker will be configured.
3. Copy the Tenant ID from the URL. The format is `https://app.snyk.io/tenant/1234abcd-1234-abcd-5678-1234abcd5678`.

When installing, you must add a command in your script to set the Broker server URL for the region where your data is hosted. For the commands and URLs to use, see [Broker URLs](../../../working-with-snyk/regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#broker-server-urls).\
Example:  `-e BROKER_SERVER_URL=https://broker.eu.snyk.io`.

If you are using a region other than SNYK US-01, run the following as applicable after you install the CLI tool and before you create your first connection:\
`export SNYK_API_HOSTNAME=https://api.REGION.snyk.io` (Linux and Mac).\
`set SNYK_API_HOSTNAME=https://api.REGION.snyk.io` (Windows)
