# Reporting and BI Integrations: Snowflake Data Share

With the new Snowflake Data Share integration, your data science, BI and AppSec teams can securely access the underlying curated datasets available in Snyk Reporting within your own Snowflake account, unlocking powerful new analytical tools to better understand and visualize Snyk data.

Use this integration to enable teams to rapidly build exploratory and custom analytics using the ecosystem of tools that Snowflake supports. Customers can connect Snyk data to BI tools like PowerBI, Tableau, and Looker Data Studio or build custom Streamlit apps.

Having Snyk's curated datasets directly in your Snowflake account is optimized for reporting use cases. It also allows you to combine Snyk data with additional data sources, which contributes to a complete AppSec view of your Organization.

## What is Snowflake Data Share? <a href="#what-is-snowflake-data-share" id="what-is-snowflake-data-share"></a>

[Snowflake Data Share](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro.html) allows companies to provide data to their customers in a secure, simple, and quick manner. With Snowflake data shares, the data is not exchanged between the accounts; instead, the data consumer is granted read-only access to the shared database through their own Snowflake account.

### Snowflake Cost Impact  <a href="#main-use-cases" id="main-use-cases"></a>

* **Storage**\
  As data is not being transferred during data sharing, there will be **no** additional storage costs attributed to your Snowflake account.
* **Compute Resources**\
  Snowflake will charge for compute resources that are used to query the data share.

## Main use cases <a href="#main-use-cases" id="main-use-cases"></a>

The Snowflake Data Share can be used for various use cases and can answer countless security and business-related questions. Some of these use cases include:

* **Enhance the AppSec posture visibility for the CISO and management team.**\
  Streamline Snyk data to your BI platforms and existing security dashboards and reflect performance metrics and KPI's, for example, MTTR, SLA compliance, remediation trends, and so on.&#x20;
* **Answer specific questions or surface unique insights.**\
  Better understand risk exposure trends, such as tracking total issues above a specific risk score only affect certain Project collections or tags across all Snyk Groups whilst filtering for only main or master branches.\
  Measure the performance of fix behaviour against SLA. For example, enter customer SLA targets and track towards those goals.\
  Build custom prevention reporting to understand shift left impact. For example, view trends in preventable Open Source vulnerabilities across all Snyk Groups, filtered by specific severities and risk scores.

## Getting started <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>

### Request Snowflake Data Share access <a href="#request-a-snowflake-data-share-access" id="request-a-snowflake-data-share-access"></a>

Follow the steps below to request Snowflake Data Share access:

1. Contact your Snyk Account Executive to request access
2. Provide your Snyk contact person with the following Snowflake account details (find [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier#finding-the-organization-and-account-name-for-an-account) guidelines to trace your credentials):
   * Account Name.
   * Organization Name.
   * If you prefer to limit the data share to a specific set of Snyk Groups, mention the relevant Group IDs (the ID is available in the Snyk Group Settings).
3. &#x20;After Snyk receives the Snowflake account details, the team will prepare the Data Share. You should expect to see your data within 24 hours.

### Prepare to consume Snowflake Data Share <a href="#prepare-to-consume-snowflake-data-shares" id="prepare-to-consume-snowflake-data-shares"></a>

The data share will be provided as a **Privately Shared Listing**. If it is the first time that you consume Snowflake data share, proceed with the steps below; otherwise, proceed to [Create a database from Snyk Data Share](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-share-consumers#creating-a-database-from-a-share):

1. Your Snowflake Organization admin (requires ORGADMIN role) should [accept Snowflake Provider and Consumer Terms of Service](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/consumer-becoming#accept-the-snowflake-provider-and-consumer-terms-of-service).
2. [Set up the required privileges](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/consumer-becoming#set-up-required-privileges) (requires ACCOUNTADMIN role or another role with CREATE DATABASE and IMPORT SHARE privileges).

### Create a Database from the Data Share <a href="#create-a-database-from-the-data-share" id="create-a-database-from-the-data-share"></a>

To get access and be able to query the data share, follow the steps below to create a database from the data share:

1. A Snowflake user with ACCOUNTADMIN role (or a role with CREATE DATABASE and IMPORT SHARE privileges) should [view the available shares](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-share-consumers#viewing-available-shares).
2. [Create a database from Snyk data share](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-share-consumers#creating-a-database-from-a-share).\
   **Note:** it can take about ten minutes for the data to be provisioned and ready to use, depending on your cloud region
3. [Grant privileges to the shared database](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-share-consumers#granting-privileges-on-a-shared-database).

### Create a Dashboard using Snyk Data

To start populating your dashboard with Snyk data, Snyk has provided [use cases and example queries](build-your-first-dashboard.md), enabling visualisation of key performance metrics relevant to AppSec goals.

Once you are familiar with building queries, Snyk encourages you to create custom queries to suit your specific requirements.

## Data policy <a href="#data-policy" id="data-policy"></a>

### Data scope and accessibility <a href="#data-freshness" id="data-freshness"></a>

* The Snowflake Data Share is scoped to the data of a requested set of Snyk Groups. A customer can request access to all Snyk groups or to specific ones.&#x20;
* Snyk shares all the data that is available for the requested Snyk Groups as exists in the Snyk database, with no additional limitations in the data share itself.
* The data share itself is provided as a read-only database and is accessible according to Snowflake standard role-based access control.

### What Data is Available? <a href="#supported-data" id="supported-data"></a>

Snyk's Data Share offering covers a variety of objects which allow for powerful reporting capabilities atop your Snyk Data, including Groups, Orgs, Projects, Issues, Usage Events and Jira Issues.

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [Data Share Dictionary](data-share-data-dictionary.md) to learn the specifics of Snyks offering.
{% endhint %}

### Data freshness <a href="#data-freshness" id="data-freshness"></a>

The data available within the share refreshes within approximately two hours. This process occurs automatically and doesn't require any action from the customer's end.

### Change Tracking

Snowflake Change Tracking is enabled on all the tables that are included in our Snowflake Data Share. This feature provides a mechanism to track changes to rows within these tables, enabling efficient incremental processing and synchronization for your workflows.

* **Retention period:** Changes are retained for two days.
* **How to use:** You can query the change tracking metadata using the CHANGES clause provided by Snowflake.

For more information on how to utilize this feature, see [Snowflake's Change Tracking Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/changes).
