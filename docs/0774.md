# Set your preferred Organization

## Set your preferred Organization

If you have several Organizations, one of these Organizations is set by default as your **Preferred Organization** in your Snyk account. A Preferred Organization determines the following:

* On the Snyk Web UI: The Organization that is displayed by default when you log in to your Snyk account.
* In the Snyk CLI: The Organization that is used by default for the test count when you scan through the CLI.\
  **Note**: To change the Organization used for the test count in the CLI, use the\
  `--org=<ORG_ID>` option. For more information, see the CLI help for the test commands: [Snyk test](../../../snyk-cli/commands/test.md), [Snyk Code test](../../../snyk-cli/commands/code-test.md), [Snyk Container test](../../../snyk-cli/commands/container-test.md), or [Snyk IaC test](../../../snyk-cli/commands/iac-test.md).

Follow these steps to change your Preferred Organization:

1\. On the Snyk Web UI, click your Account icon at the bottom left corner of the screen. Then select the **Account settings** option:

3\. Click the **Update Preferred Org** button to save your new setting.

The Organization you selected as your **Preferred Organization** is displayed when you log in to your Snyk account and used by default for the test count when you scan using the CLI.
