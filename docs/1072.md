# Snyk Jumpstart Services Description

## Overview of Snyk Jumpstart

A Snyk Consultant will provide services to help the  Customer accelerate its setup of Snyk products through assisted account configuration (the “Jumpstart Services”). The engagement will consist of knowledge transfer, paired with configuration guidance for your team.&#x20;

The objective is a working setup of Snyk and a Customer team that is well-prepared to continue its application security efforts.

**Jumpstart is recommended for**:

* Teams needing assistance with the setup of Snyk products
* Teams who are new to Snyk and have limited experience with security scanning
* Self-starters who are comfortable with extending and maintaining Snyk on their own, post-engagement

## Jumpstart Services description

The Snyk Consultant will deliver the following services related to the setup of Snyk remotely as part of the Jumpstart Services to the Customer. Note that the Jumpstart Services will be delivered only for the Snyk Applications purchased on an Order Form at the same time as this service. References to Snyk Services not purchased by the Customer are hereby omitted unless otherwise noted.

## Timeline for Snyk Jumpstart delivery

Snyk Jumpstart delivery is an eight-week engagement that begins with the Pre-engagement call.&#x20;

This engagement will include initial Platform Configuration and each product module that has been purchased. Modules have been designed to be delivered consecutively during the Product Deployment stage, as shown below:

## Additional terms

The fees for this project will be a fixed price. Services will be invoiced in full at the time of purchase and are non-refundable.&#x20;

Upon purchase, the Snyk implementation team will coordinate a pre-engagement call at a time that works for both parties. Note that Jumpstart services expire 120 days after our consultant's first outreach, regardless of customer engagement. All Jumpstart Services automatically conclude either upon completion or eight weeks following the kick-off call, whichever occurs first.

Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, a) services must be scheduled as agreed during the pre-engagement call; b) product modules will be delivered consecutively; and c) all services will occur during normal business hours.&#x20;

All services will be performed remotely. Any onsite time requires Snyk’s prior consent and will be subject to additional fees and expenses to be agreed in advance.&#x20;
