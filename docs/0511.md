When you connect to the ECR integration, ensure that the us-east-2 region is activated. This is required for the STS (Security Token Service) to work properly. For more information, see the [related support article](https://support.snyk.io/s/article/Connecting-to-ECR-Integration-gives-error-Could-not-connect-to-ECR-Please-ensure-your-credentials-are-correctly-configured).
