# Issue IDs in Snyk APIs

The `issueid` in the V1 API is the issue identifier from the Snyk Vulnerability Database, for example, SNYK-JS-LODASH-6139239.

The Snyk REST API shows the issue ID generated when an issue is identified through a Snyk scan, for example, 4a18d42f-0706-4ad0-b127-24078731fbed. The string is unique, but is always a sequence of numbers and letters and has the same length.
