# Disconnect and clean up

The `snyk-broker-config workflows <RESOURCE> delete` commands allow you to remove resources.&#x20;

Protections are in place to prevent invalid connection states, so you cannot delete connections that are integrated, and therefore relied upon, by Organizations. You must disconnect the integration before deleting the connection.

`snyk-broker-config workflows connections delete` walks you through the disconnection steps.

For all resources, you must delete the child items before you can delete a parent, as illustrated in the diagram that follows. A deployment contains connections and credentials references. Connections use credentials references. Each connection may have an integration with one or more Organizations.

`snyk-broker-config` commands walk you through this flow and indicate what needs to be done to achieve successful deletion. These commands implement and enforce the following rules:

* Before you delete a connection, you must disconnect all integrations.
* Before you delete a credentials reference, you must delete the connection(s) using it.
* Before you delete a deployment, you must delete all connections and credentials references.
