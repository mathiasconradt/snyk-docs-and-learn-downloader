# SCM Integrations and Python

## Set the Python version in Git Projects

The supported versions of Python are `2.7`, `3.7`, `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`, `3.13`.

When scanning Pip Projects imported from Git, Snyk uses the version of Python specified in Organization settings or `.snyk` files.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is important to specify the correct Python version for your Organization, as it can affect the version of dependencies used in scanning your Projects.
{% endhint %}

Snyk uses a recent `patch` version for each of the supported `minor` version.

By default, Snyk tests Pip Projects using Python 3.7.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The behavior of imports, re-tests, and PR checks for Projects with dependencies requiring a higher version of Python varies according to the version specified:

* Python 3.8 or above: scans will fail with an [error](../../scan-with-snyk/error-catalog.md) message that includes details of the first failed package, the Python version it requires, and the Python version used.
* Python 2.7 or 3.7: scans will succeed, but the incompatible dependencies are omitted from the results.
{% endhint %}

To define which Python minor version Snyk uses to test your Git-imported Pip Projects, you can use Organization settings and [`.snyk` policy file](../../manage-risk/policies/the-.snyk-file.md).

To define the Python version for all Projects in an Organization:

1. Log in to your Snyk account and navigate to the relevant Group and Organization.
2. Select **Settings** > **Snyk Open Source**.
3. Select **Edit settings** for **Python**.
4. From the **Python version** dropdown, select the Python version to use when testing Projects for this Organization.

If you require a Project in an Organization to use a different Python version, you may add a `.snyk` file to the Project repository and specify the desired version.

```python
language-settings:
  python: '3.10'
```

The `.snyk` file must be in the same directory as the Project manifest file.

Snyk will select which Python version to use according to the `major`, `minor` and `patch` versions specified in the `.snyk` file.

* `Major` version only (for example, 2 or 3): scanned with default `minor` versions - 2.7 or 3.7
* `Major` and `minor` version (for example, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13): scanned with 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13
* `Major`, `minor` and `patch` version (or example, 3.8.x, 3.9.x, 3.10.x, 3.11.x, 3.12.x, 3.13.x): the specific `patch` version is ignored, the Project is scanned with default versions of 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13
* Any versions specified with an unsupported `minor` version: defaults to 2.7 or 3.7

## SCM integration and Snyk for Python

{% hint style="warning" %}
Python packages that are operating system-specific and not supported by Linux may not be compatible with Snyk SCM scans, leading to errors.
{% endhint %}

To scan your Projects, you must ensure your repository contains the supported manifest files.

### Pip and SCM repositories

The following dependencies are not supported and are removed before the file is scanned. The remaining dependencies are included in the scan.

* Private PyPI repos
* `file://`, regular URLs, relative paths, and more generally URIs in `requirements.txt` files
* Setting a different package index with `--index-url`, `-i`, `--extra-index-url`&#x20;
* Specifying dependency archive locations with `--find-links`, `-f`
* Installing a dependency in editable mode with `--editable`, `-e`&#x20;
* Relying on a version constraints file with `--constraint`, `-c`
* Including another requirement file with `--requirement`, `-r`&#x20;
* Specific packages: `virtualenv` and `pip` for Python 2.7 and 3.7

{% hint style="warning" %}
Projects with downloaded dependencies totalling more than 10GB are not supported.
{% endhint %}

To scan Pip Projects, Snyk analyzes your `requirements.txt` files using native `pip` tooling in an isolated Linux environment.

Pip Projects scanned using the SCM integration will be given the same name as the directory where they are located.&#x20;

Snyk imports any file that follows the `**/*req*.txt` pattern. This can help if you have renamed the `requirements.txt` files, for example, to `requirements-dev.txt`.

Snyk also looks for files using the `**/requirements/*.txt` pattern. This can help if you have placed your files in a `requirements` folder, for example, `requirements/requirements.txt`.

If you are using a package manager that creates different manifest file formats from `requirements.txt`, then you may be able to convert or export the manifest file to the `requirements.txt` format.

An example follows of how `dephell` is used to convert from Conda `environments.yml` to a `requirements.txt`.

```python
dephell deps convert --from=conda --to=requirements.txt
```

### Poetry and SCM repositories

Poetry v1 and v2 are supported.

To scan Poetry Projects, Snyk inspects your `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files.

You can choose whether Snyk should include [dev dependencies](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-dependencies/) when scanning your Poetry Projects.

Snyk regards non-dev dependencies to be those declared in `tool.poetry.dependencies`, the implicit `main` group. All others are classed as dev dependencies.

Poetry dev dependencies are not included in scans by default. To change this, modify your settings as follows:

1. Log in to your Snyk account and navigate to the relevant Group and Organization.
2. Select **Settings** > **Languages**.
3. Select **Edit settings** for **Python**.
4. Enable or disable the **Scan Poetry dev dependencies** option under the **Poetry dev dependencies** settings.&#x20;

### Pipenv and SCM repositories

{% hint style="warning" %}
Private PyPI mirrors are not supported. `Pipfiles` specifying a private mirror as their only source will not be imported.
{% endhint %}

To scan Pipenv Projects, Snyk analyzes your `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files using native `pipenv` tooling in an isolated Linux environment.

{% hint style="info" %}
Packages from private repositories and those with non-Linux OS requirements may be unresolvable and omitted from the dependency tree.

If a `Pipfile.lock` is present, any unresolved packages it contains are added to the top level of the dependency tree using versions from the lock file.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You can choose whether Snyk should include dependencies specified in `[dev-packages]` when scanning your Pipenv Projects.

Pipenv dev dependencies are not included in scans by default. To change this, modify your settings as follows:

1. Log in to your Snyk account and navigate to the relevant Group and Organization.
2. Select **Settings** > **Languages**.
3. Select **Edit settings** for **Python**.
4. Enable or disable the **Scan Pipenv dev dependencies** option under the **Pipenv** settings.&#x20;
