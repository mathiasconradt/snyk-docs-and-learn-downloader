# Provision users to Organizations using the API

The Provision user endpoints allow you to organize and grant permissions to your single sign-on users before the users log in to the Snyk platform. The endpoints are [Provision a user to the organizaton](../../snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1.md#org-orgid-provision), [List pending user provisions](../../snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1.md#org-orgid-provision-1), and [Delete pending user provision](../../snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1.md#org-orgid-provision-2).

Provisioned users do not need to accept invites. When provisioned users first log in to Snyk, they will have all their permissions. You can use the endpoint [Provision a user to the organization](../../snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1.md#org-orgid-provision) to add users to Organizations at scale before their first login.

## Prerequisites for provisioning users using the API

{% hint style="info" %}
The API does not support using service accounts as the inviting user or provisioned user.
{% endhint %}

* The user being provisioned must not already exist in the Snyk system.
* The inviting user must call the API using a personal token.
* The Snyk Group to which the Organizations belong should have [Single Sign On (SSO) configured](../../enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/).
* Both the inviting user and the provisioned user must log in using SSO.
* The inviting user should have the permission `Provision Users` to invoke these calls. All Group and Org Admins, by default, have this permission.

## How to use the Provision user API

The following explains how to use the Provision user endpoints. For more information, see the API documentation for the endpoints: [Provision a user to the organizaton](../../snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1.md#org-orgid-provision), [List pending user provisions](../../snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1.md#org-orgid-provision-1), and [Delete pending user provision](../../snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1.md#org-orgid-provision-2).

### Provision a user to the Organization

You can use the endpoint [Provision a user to the organizaton](../../snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1.md#org-orgid-provision) to provision a user to the specified Organization with a role. When a user first logs into Snyk, the user is automatically assigned the permissions as defined in the role.

**`POST`** `https://api.snyk.io/v1/org/orgId/provision`

**Request model:**

`{`

`"email": "test@example.com",`

`"rolePublicId": "",`

`"role": "ADMIN"`

`}`

**Response model:**

`{`

`"email": "test@example.com",`

`"rolePublicId": "",`

`"role": "ADMIN",`

{% hint style="info" %}
Enterprise plan users can define their own customized [member roles](../user-roles/user-role-management.md) and can use the`rolePublicId` for assignment.\
\
You can use either `role` or `rolePublicId` but not both in the same call.
{% endhint %}
