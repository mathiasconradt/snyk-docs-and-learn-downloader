## Use cases for assignments

### Onboarding new employees

Ensure new employees complete their onboarding training within a designated timeframe. Assignments can include mandatory onboarding training content. The progress reset feature allows re-onboarding by clearing previous progress.

### Annual secure coding training

Mandate annual secure coding training for all employees. Assignments can span a specific year period and include relevant security education content. The admin can use the progress reset feature to reset last yearâ€™s progress for the new cycle.

### Product update training for the development team

Ensure developers are trained on new product features. Admins can create assignments that include product training content on new features. If significant updates require retraining, the admin can use the progress reset feature.

### Compliance training

Ensure employees complete training for compliance requirements, such as PCI DSS, SOX, SOC-2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 certification. Admins can create assignments that cover the effective period of new regulations, including content required by compliance. The admin can use the progress reset feature to reset previous progress and mandate updated training.

## Who can be assigned Snyk Learn lessons?

Assignments are linked to the individual user and can be tracked from any Organization they are a member of.

Snyk requires users to log in to the platform before they become active users and are available for assignments.
