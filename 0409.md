# Third-party integrations for Snyk AppRisk

The Integrations page shows all active integrations, including data from your existing Snyk Organizations that are automatically synced, and provides access to the Integration Hub.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Loaded package risk factor is not supported by Snyk for operating system packages (such as Debian packages), only for packages hosted under package managers such as npm, Maven, or PyPI.
{% endhint %}

You can customize your AppRisk integrations from the **Integrations Hub** where the following integrations are available:

* [Veracode SAST](connect-a-third-party-integration.md#veracode-setup-guide)
* [Checkmarx SAST ](connect-a-third-party-integration.md#checkmarx-setup-guide)
* [SonarQube](connect-a-third-party-integration.md#sonarqube-setup-guide)
* [Nightfall](connect-a-third-party-integration.md#nightfall-setup-guide)
* [GitGuardian](connect-a-third-party-integration.md#gitguardian-setup-guide)
* [Dynatrace](connect-a-third-party-integration.md#dynatrace-setup-guide)
* [Sysdig](connect-a-third-party-integration.md#sysdig-setup-guide)

{% hint style="info" %}
Data synchronization may take up to two hours after receiving the **Connected** status from a new integration setup. See the [Integration connected statuses](../../../integrate-with-snyk/#integration-connection-statuses) page for more details.
{% endhint %}

After you finish setting up an integration, you can see it listed with a Connected status.

* The user is associated with a group that has permissions (through policies) to query the entity model. In the Dynayrace policy, set the following permission: `storage:entities:read`.

Comply with the following steps before integrating Dynatrace with Snyk AppRisk:

1. Retrieve the `account-uuid` from your Dynatrace account. Navigate to the [Dynatrace accounts](https://myaccount.dynatrace.com/accounts) page and select the account whose environment you want to integrate into Snyk. Identify the `account-uuid` in the URL and save it for later use.
2. Ensure you have OneAgent deployed in your Kubernetes environment. Navigate to `Settings` then `Environments` and select the environment you want to integrate into Snyk. Save the environment ID for later use (available in the URL of the new window as well). Click `Deploy OneAgent` then `Kubernetes` and follow the instructions. Ensure OneAgent is running in full-stack mode.
3. Ensure your deployment is activated. On your environment's page, click `Kubernetes` , then `Recommendations` and activate the cluster where you deployed OneAgent.
4. Under **account management**:
   * Create a new Permissions Group. Add the following permissions to the group:
     * Enable `View and manage account and billing information` under Account Management permissions.
     * Add both `All Grail data read access` and `Read Events` under general permissions.
   * Create a new, dedicated user to be used by the integration and assign to it the newly created Permissions Group mentioned above.
   * Create a new OAuth client:
     * Set the Service User Email as the email address of the newly generated user mentioned above.
     * Set the Permissions for the client - Under `Grail data ingest and query` select `View entities (storage:entities:read)`.
     * Ensure to hold a copy of the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to be used in a later phase when configuring the integration in Snyk.
