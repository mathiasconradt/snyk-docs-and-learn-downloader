## Brownouts

Brownouts occur when Snyk temporarily suspends an API endpoint or a feature, making it unavailable for use. This situation indicates that the resource or service is still operational, but its performance is reduced compared to its normal or expected capacity.

### End of support features

When a feature transitions to an end-of-support stage, both development and support work are terminated.&#x20;

The documentation page will announce the transition of a feature to End of Support six months before its start date.

**Snyk Docker Desktop extension**

The[ Snyk Docker Desktop extension](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/container-registry-integrations/integrate-with-docker-desktop-extension.md) will no longer be supported starting June 20, 2025. After this date, the extension will no longer receive updates or technical support. Until June 20, 2025, updates for this integration will only address known high-severity security vulnerabilities.&#x20;

**Recommended alternative**&#x20;

To avoid disruptions, Snyk recommends transitioning to scanning your container images using the [Snyk CLI](../snyk-cli/). This provides enhanced functionality, flexibility, and performance.

### End of life features

A feature can also be the subject of an end-of-life event, meaning that the feature or capability impacted by this process ceases to exist and is removed from the product and public documentation.

API endpoints have a dedicated section for the end of life process and also provide details about the migration steps. Navigate to the [API End of Life process and migration guides](../api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides/) for more details.
