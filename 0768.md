# Groups

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
This feature is available only with Enterprise Plans. For more information, see [plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/).
{% endhint %}

Snyk Groups make it easier for you to work in teams. Groups can contain many Organizations, and each Organization can contain many collaborators and Projects.

As part of your onboarding, Snyk sets you up with a Group for your company. You can then add your current Organizations to this Group. If you think your company will need multiple Groups, submit a request to [Snyk Support](https://support.snyk.io). See [Structure your account for high application performance](../../structure-your-account-for-high-application-performance.md) for details concerning multiple Groups.

## Group-level options

Use Group-level options to view [Organizations](./#group-organizations), [reports](./#group-reports), [dependencies](./#group-dependencies), and [policies](./#group-policies) across all of the Organizations in your Group, configure your [Group settings](./#group-settings), and view all the [users](./#group-members) in a Group.

If your Group is set up to let its users join Organizations, you also see a list of all the Organizations in the Group and options to join the Organizations where you are not a member.

For a detailed breakdown of user roles and their associated access permissions, see [User roles](../../user-roles/).
