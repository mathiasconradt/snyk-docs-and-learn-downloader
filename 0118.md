# GitHub Enterprise - install and configure using Helm

Before installing, review the [prerequisites](./) and the general instructions for installation using [Helm](../install-and-configure-broker-using-helm.md).

To use this chart, you must first add the Snyk Broker Helm Chart by adding the repo:

`helm repo add snyk-broker https://snyk.github.io/snyk-broker-helm/`&#x20;

Then, run the following commands to install the Broker and customize the environment variables. Refer to [GitHub Enterprise - environment variables for Snyk Broker](github-enterprise-environment-variables-for-snyk-broker.md) for definitions of the environment variables.

`ACCEPT_CODE` is [set to true by default](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-broker-helm/blob/465d4ef279755fa5c9507975a88348bab04c2264/charts/snyk-broker/templates/broker_deployment.yaml#L383) in the chart, as is [ACCEPT\_IAC](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-broker-helm/blob/465d4ef279755fa5c9507975a88348bab04c2264/charts/snyk-broker/templates/broker_deployment.yaml#L386C23-L386C43). You can disable them if needed using `disableAutoAcceptRules=true`, but otherwise, these are enabled.

Snyk Essentials is set by default to `false`. Enable it by setting the flag to `true`.

For `github`, `githubApi` and `githubGraphQl` values do not include `https://`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Multi-tenant settings for regions**\
When installing, you must add a command in your script to set the `brokerServerUrl`. This is the URL of the Broker server for the region where your data is hosted. For the commands and URLs to use, see [Broker URLs](../../../../../working-with-snyk/regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#broker-server-urls).
{% endhint %}

```
helm install snyk-broker-chart snyk-broker/snyk-broker \
             --set scmType=github-enterprise \
             --set brokerToken=<ENTER_BROKER_TOKEN> \
             --set brokerServerUrl=<broker-region-url>
             --set scmToken=<ENTER_REPO_TOKEN> \
             --set github=<ENTER_GHE_ADDRESS> \
             --set githubApi=<ENTER_GHE_API_ADDRESS> \
             --set githubGraphQl=<ENTER_GRAPHQL_ADDRESS> \
             --set enableEssentials=true \
             --set brokerClientUrl=<ENTER_BROKER_CLIENT_URL>:<ENTER_BROKER_CLIENT_PORT> \
             -n snyk-broker --create-namespace
```

You can pass any environment variable of your choice in the Helm command. For details, see [Custom additional options for Broker Helm Chart](../advanced-configuration-for-helm-chart-installation/custom-additional-options-for-broker-helm-chart-installation.md). Follow the instructions for [Advanced configuration for Helm Chart installation](../advanced-configuration-for-helm-chart-installation/) to make configuration changes as needed.

You can verify that the Broker is running by looking at the settings for your brokered integration in the Snyk Web UI to see a confirmation message that you are connected. You can start importing Projects once you are connected.
