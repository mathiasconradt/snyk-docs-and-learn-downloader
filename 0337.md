# Snyk Images migration

You can [create your own custom images](../user-defined-custom-images-for-cli.md) to use. This option is available for any user affected by the removal of the Snyk Images listed on this page.

Creating a custom image is the preferred solution, as it should guarantee compatibility with your system. However, if you cannot create a custom image, you can use an available alternative image.

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk recommends using a pinned version of a software package unless stated otherwise.
