# Group Projects by branch or version for monitoring

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**

Grouping Projects by branch or version is available only for Enterprise plans. For more information, see [Plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans).

The feature is supported for areas of Open Source.
{% endhint %}

Your Project may have multiple states that you want to monitor separately, for example, branches, releases, or deployments. You can use the `--target-reference` option to separate Projects into these specific groupings.

`--target-reference` takes any text so you can combine it with a command to automatically set it to a value. Examples follow.

Set `--target-reference` to the current Git branch.

```
snyk monitor --target-reference="$(git branch --show-current)"
```

Use the latest Git tag.

```
snyk monitor --target-reference="$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)"
```

You can adjust the option for the developer tools used in your project. Any valid Git target can be used.

`--target-reference` allows you to create sub-groupings on the Projects page.
