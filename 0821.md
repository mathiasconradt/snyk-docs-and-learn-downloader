# Access requirements

When you are using Snyk applications like the [CLI ](../getting-started-with-the-snyk-cli.md)or [IDE integrations](../../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions/), certain local and remote resources must be accessible. This documentation explains how to harden your system without affecting Snyk functionality.

## Local filesystem

The required filesystem access may vary by product.

* CACHE\_PATH (Read,Write,Execute)
  * Windows: `C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\snyk`

  * macOS: `/Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Caches/snyk`
* CONFIG\_PATH (Read,Write)
  * Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\\.config\\configstore`
  * Linux: `$HOME/.config/configstore`
  * macOs: `$HOME/.config/configstore`
