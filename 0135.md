# Artifactory Repository - install and configure using Helm

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**

Integration with Artifactory Repository is available only with Enterprise plans. For more information, see [plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/).
{% endhint %}

Before installing, review the [prerequisites](./) and the general instructions for installation using [Helm](../install-and-configure-broker-using-helm.md).

For information about non-brokered integration with Artifactory Repository see [Artifactory Repository setup](../../../../../scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source/package-repository-integrations/artifactory-package-repository-connection-setup/). For information about brokered integration with Artifactory Container Registry see [Snyk Broker -Container Registry Agent](../../../snyk-broker-container-registry-agent/).

To use this chart, you must first add the Snyk Broker Helm Chart by adding the repo:

`helm repo add snyk-broker https://snyk.github.io/snyk-broker-helm/`&#x20;

Then, run the following commands to install the Broker and customize the environment variables. For definitions of the environment variables see [Artifactory Repository - environment variables for Snyk Broker](artifactory-repository-environment-variables-for-snyk-broker.md).

For `artifactoryUrl` values do not include `https://`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Multi-tenant settings for regions**\
When installing, you must add a command in your script to set the `brokerServerUrl`. This is the URL of the Broker server for the region where your data is hosted. For the commands and URLs to use, see [Broker URLs](../../../../../working-with-snyk/regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#broker-server-urls).
{% endhint %}

```
helm install snyk-broker-chart snyk-broker/snyk-broker \
             --set scmType=artifactory \
             --set brokerToken=<ENTER_BROKER_TOKEN> \
             --set brokerServerUrl=<broker-region-url>
             --set artifactoryUrl=<ENTER_ARTIFACTORY_URL> \
             -n snyk-broker --create-namespace
```

You can pass any environment variable of your choice in the Helm command. For details, see [Custom additional options for Broker Helm Chart](../advanced-configuration-for-helm-chart-installation/custom-additional-options-for-broker-helm-chart-installation.md). Follow the instructions for [Advanced configuration for Helm Chart installation](../advanced-configuration-for-helm-chart-installation/) to make configuration changes as needed.

You can verify that the Broker is running by looking at the settings for your brokered integration in the Snyk Web UI to see a confirmation message that you are connected. You can start importing Projects once you are connected.
