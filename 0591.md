# Writing rules using the SDK

To get you started with the SDK, you will learn how to:

1. [Parse a fixture file](parsing-an-input-file.md), to help you understand how to write a rule.
2. [â€‹Write a rule with the SDK](writing-a-rule.md) using Rego.
3. [Add unit tests for the rules you have written](testing-a-rule.md) to verify your rules.
4. [Build a bundle containing your custom rules](bundling-rules.md) so that you can [use it with the Snyk CLI](../use-iac-custom-rules-with-cli/).
5. [Push the bundle containing your custom rules to a container registry](pushing-a-bundle.md) so that you can [enforce its usage with the Snyk CLI](../use-iac-custom-rules-with-cli/).
